# What is ProjexNexa?

ProjexNexa is a modern project dashboard built from the ground-up to be a easy way to showcase your project's milestones and progress. ProjexNexa for now is for Windows but down the line its going to cross-platform and since its using [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/) framework, it can run on all platforms, Windows, MacOS, and Linux without any trouble. Some ProjexNexa's features in summary are:

* It looks modern
* Easy to use
* Upload and import project lists from a excel sheet
* and most importantly is Open Source Software (OSS)!

ProjexNexa is currently under development. You give your suggestions on the [discussions](https://github.com/EasyCanadianGamer/ProjexNexa/discussions) page.

If you feel comfortable in writing code using Typescript and Rust, we highly encourage you to contribute to this project.
